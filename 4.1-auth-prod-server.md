# Authentication & Production Server

## JWT

JWT stands for Json Web Token and is a way for clients and servers to communicate securely using JSON objects (which can be signed and/or encrypted, for security.) The token is split into 3 parts: header, payload, and signature.

* The header contains information about the signature and type of token.
* The payload contains the information to be sent, such as login details, a message to post, or anything else.
* The signature is the result of using a private key, and can only be verified with the corresponding public key. This can be used to validate that (barring extreme circumstances) the sender is who they claim to be.

Each of these parts is split by a period. 

### JWT compared to other similar web tokens

* relatively small amount of data overhead
* relatively good security
* quick to set up
* runs in many different environments, because almost all environments can work with JSON data
