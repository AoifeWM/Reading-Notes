## What is growth mindset? 
Growth mindset is being open to new ideas and learning wherever possible. This means not letting challenges stand in your way, but instead seeing them as an opportunity to improve and *grow*. Someone with growth mindset is happy to see other people do well, because they see it as an inspiration rather than a competition. Growth mindset is important for learning because it allows you to make the most out of your oppurtunities wherever they arise. 
* Growth mindset means keeping a **positive attitude** in the face of challenges.
* Growth mindset means seeing failure as an opportunity to learn, rather than a setback.
* Growth mindset means never being jealous of the success of others, but rather seeing their success as a possibility for what you could achieve too.
