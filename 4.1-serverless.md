# Serverless development model

Serverless development refers to a process where developers can created web-based applications without actually managing any servers, instead contracting this process out to a cloud provider. There's a huge amount of work that goes into maintaining servers with processes like updates, reboots, security, downtime management, etc. and this process is a skillset entirely of its own. By using servers of other people the developer avoids all this hassle and can instead focus on the quality of their application. Serverless does not mean "no servers". The servers are still there, just not managed by the developer themself. This does give the developer slightly less manual control of the server and how exactly the code is deployed, but most services that offer cloud infrascructure give users lots of options within this, so unless incredibly fine control is required, this isn't usually a problem.
*Event-based architecture* refers to how the cloud server is only running your functions in the specific event that they're called on, for instance by end-user interaction. This means that you aren't spending computing power (and, in most cases, money) on *idle time* which refers to the time that normal server running a single application has to sit there, full computing capacity at the ready, even while users are not actually using the application. Event-based architecture circumvents this by having many applications running on the same servers at the same time; so when your application is not in use, that computing power will be used for other applications, and you will not pay for the idle time.
