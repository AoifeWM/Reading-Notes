# Testing and Modules in Python

## TDD

TDD stands for Test Driven Development. It means that *before* you write any code, you establish a desired behavior and come up with potential input and a corresponding output the program should give. Then you write unit tests for that behavior. After all that *then* you can start coding, and you do it with the unit tests in mind, not worrying about how beautiful or efficient the first code is. And then once you've got a working product, you can go back and refactor. Doing it in this order makes sure that you're always working to your intended MVP and makes sure that you aren't overwhelmed with unexpected bugs when you first get it working, because your tests will catch them quickly whenever they come up.

## Scripts versus Modules

In python, there are two main ways a piece of your code can be used by another person: as a module and as a script. To put it simply, a script is when it's being run as a standalone file, and a module is when it's being imported into another codebase. 

There's a clause in a lot of python files like this: `if __name__ == "__main__':`. What this does is determines if the file is being run as a script (returning `true`) or a module (returning `false`). You can use this to make sure your code runs properly; for instance, say most of your program is enclosed in a function, which performs the main purpose of the code. If a user runs your code as a standalone script, they probably want to use that function immediately, and so it makes sense to initialize it when the code is loaded. On the other hand, if they're running it as a module, they have access to your functions, and you can trust them to call it when their program needs it. By invoking your primary function inside of the `if __name__ == "__main__':` statement it means that the function will run automatically as a script, but won't do anything if it's imported as a module until it's specifically called. Even if your program is only meant to be run as a script, it can be helpful to use this statement, because it lets another person inspecting your code understand that it was created with being run as a script in mind.

## Recursion

Iteration is seperating a large task out into many smaller tasks that all require a similar or identical process to complete, and then condensing that task into a relatively very short set of instructions for the computer to perform. For instance, when calculating 5 factorial `5!` we can use iteration to split it into two tasks: calculating 4 factorial, and calculating 5 times that number, `5 * 4!`. And we can keep splitting it off like that,  `5 * 4 * 3!` etc., until we have a singular identical step we can have the computer run 5 times and get our answer something like this:

```
i = 5
currentStep = 1
totalVariable = 1
while currentStep is <= i:
    set totalVariable to totalVariable times current step
    set currentStep to currentStep + 1
```

Recursion is when we instead use our function to call itself to repeat the next step; For example:

```
function factorial(int i):
    if i = 1:
        return 1
    return i * factorial(i - 1)
```

Instead of explicitly telling the function how many times to loop, it just keeps invoking itself naturally, until it hits one and doesn't have to call itself anymore, because `1!` equals 1. Then all of the factorial functions return their values back down the **stack** and multiply together. The **stack** refers to the chain of seperate running instances of this function, which is each waiting on the next one in line to give it a response so it can pass along its own response to the one previous.
