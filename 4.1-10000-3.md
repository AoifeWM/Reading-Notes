## List comprehensions

List comprehension is a very useful tool in python. It allows you to easily populate lists using any object that can have an `in` (for example, other lists, tuples). It allows you to do this inline without writing the loop around it. Here's some examples of what list comprehensions can do:

* `odd_numbers = [x%2 == 1 for x in range(20)]`
  * when the expression is true, X will be added to the list. When it's not, it won't be; this will give you a list of all odd numbers 1-20.
* `halved_nums = [x/2 for x in nums]`
  * this populates the list `halved nums` with the contents of the list `nums`, but each item in `nums` is divided by two.

List comprehensions save a lot of space in the long run (at least one line per list comprehension to make a loop with) and also make these tasks quicker to code.

## Things I want to know more about

Are list comprehensions just basically shorthand for the larger loop? like does the compiler or interpreter or whatever the thing is called that turns aliased functions into their actual basic instructions, does that thing just expand the halved nums loop above out into `for x in range(len(nums)): halved_nums[x] = nums[x]/2`, for example? or is it actually doing some whole different thing internally?
