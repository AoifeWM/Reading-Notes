## Scope in python

Scope means basically where references to things (eg. variables, objects, functions, imported modules) 'live' and can be used. If an object is in scope, you can target it with the name that's been defined for it in that scope. If it's out of scope, you won't be able to interact with it until you do enter a scope it exists in. There's also **global scope** which means it can be accessed from anywhere. To avoid naming conflicts and accidentally referencing things you didn't mean to, nothing should exist in global scope unless it's essential for it to be there. 

Scope is handled in Python by using dictionaries to make namespaces. 

### LEGB

The acronym LEGB refers to the way python prioritizes different types of scope when trying to find an item, given a name. The acronym stands for:

* Local scope
  * This refers to things that have been created or named in the space that is being immediately used by the script; for instance, if you create a function, and on the first line of that function, you declare x = 1, x would be locally scoped while accessed from within the function.
* Enclosing scope
  * This refers to things that have been created or named in a space immediately enclosing the area that is being used; for instance, if you create a function, and on the first line of that function, you declare x = 1, and then later in the function you enter a for loop, while you're in that for loop, then x is in the enclosing scope, and if you modify it, you're modifying the same one stored on the first line of the function.
* Global scope
  * This refers to things named in the top level of your script (ie. not inside of any kind of function, loop, class, or etc.) and the entire script will have access to it, so if it's changed, it will also be changed everywhere else in your code.
* Built-in
  * This refers to things that are automatically loaded into python, for instance, built-in keywords, functions, and expressions. These will be accessible to all of your code unless something really drastic happens.
