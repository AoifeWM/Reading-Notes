# React part 2

More nuance to the react system is discussed here.

## Thinking in react

There's a general procedure for the best way to work with react. First, you should take the mockup of the website and isolate each element that you'll need to render. Just like the *Single responsibility principle*, these elements should be very specific to a singular purpose. Then, using react, hard-code out a static version of your page, without any functionality. Then identify all the places that *state* will be used for the UI (i.e. something which might update over time, like a search form). Then you identify what part of your code the states should exist in. Basically, the state should be in the lowest level component which is a parent to every single other component which will use the state. Ideally, this component shouldn't have very many children other than the components which need direct access to this state. If a component which matches this description doesn't exist, you should make one just to fill this role. Then you just link up the data flow (actually code out the state and its functions) and then the site should work.

## Conditional rendering

Components can be set up to render based on certain conditions, using *if* statements just like regular javascript. A way to make this easier is to set elements that will be conditionally rendered as their own variable, and then just render that whole variable if the conditions are met.
