# Encryption and Cryptography

Encryption is the process of obscuring a message or some other information by using some kind of reversible algorithm to turn it into unreadable text. This is extremely useful in computing because it is pretty much the only way to keep information that's hosted publically online private. This is essential for something like password storage. If the correct passwords were stored as plaintext, anyone with a bit of computer savvy could look through the website and just find a list of passwords sitting there. 
There are some important keywords that describe this process:

* Plaintext:
  * The readable message or other information that is intended to be hidden (for instance, in computing this is often not a message but personal information, credit card details, login passwords, etc.)
* Cyphertext:
  * The obscured text, once it's been encrypted.
* Encryption:
  * The process of obscuring the plaintext by applying some algorithm
* Decryption:
  * the process of using the reverse of a given encryption algorithm to turn the cyphertext back into plaintext.
* Codebreaking or cracking:
  * Using various methods to figure out the decryption algorithm without knowing it beforehand, usually against the will of the person who encrypted it.
