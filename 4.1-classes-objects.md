# Classes, Objects, and Recursion in Python

To use python or any other high level OOP language to its full extent, it's important to know some key features. Among them are Classes and Objects, as well as recursion. These tools help organize code, make execution more efficient, and open up possibilities that would be nearly impossible otherwise.

## Objects

Objects are basically just containers that can hold both variables and functions. When an object has variables assigned to it they are called **properties** and likewise the functions are called **methods**. Objects are very useful in situations where you want to store a data point which is too complicated to be easily stored in a list; for instance, if you wrote a program for a car dealership, you'd probably want to track the individual cars they have for sale as seperate objects. Like a list, this allows you to store many values together in a bundle (such as model, year, mileage, price, etc.), but unlike a list, this data is much easier to work with because each property can be accessed by its name (for instance, example_car.name == "Honda oddessy"), instead of keeping a key somewhere which explains "index 0 is the model, index 2 is the year, etc.". The other advantage over lists means you can attach methods specifically to the car; for instance, a `sold()` method which automatically removes the car from the list of cars for sale, but transitions the car object into another database which tracks sold cars for record keeping purposes. Because of this, when working with many complex but similarly structured pieces of data, objects are often the best method of handling them.

## Classes

Classes are basically templates for objects. By defining a class once, it's easy to make many objects out of it, all with different specific values for their properties, but still the same underlying structure and functionality. In the above example, you could define all of the car's properties generically in the class, and then easily assign them as needed each time you create each car object. This simplifies the process of creating many similar objects, especially when it comes to attaching methods to them. Classes are the foundation which holds up the power of objects and makes them easy to use.

### \_\_init\_\_

`__init__` is an important function when writing a class because it is what will be used to set up the resulting objects. Basically, this allows you to pass values into the object's properties in the same step as you create it.

## Recursion

Recursion is another powerful tool in the python toolkit. It's a broad definition for a specific way of approaching certain types of tasks where many similar actions have to be repeated. Recursion means roughly that a piece of code does a small portion of the task at hand, and then delegates the next part of the task to one or multiple other copies of itself. This builds a series of requests called the **stack** where each instance of the code is waiting on other instances of it. Once the problem has been sufficiently divided and the smallest subtasks can be completed, they pass their data up the *stack* and the stack **unwinds** as each instance recieves the data it needs, performs an operation, passes on the new data, and terminates itself.
