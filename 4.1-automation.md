## Regex in Python

Regex is a powerful tool for processing text in various ways, availiable in many different languages. In python, the library is called `re`. A useful tool for regex is prefacing strings with `r`, which will make the string a *raw string literal* which means it ignores the special properties of certain characters, like "\", which is usually used as an escape character in python. However, characters that are special to regex, such as ".", which is a wildcard (meaning any character will fulfill it) are still processed normally by regex. 

## shutil

`shutil` is a python library which can be used for various file operations, such as copying, (`copyfile()`), copying with metadata still in tact, such as permissions and user information (`copy2()`), copying that metadata from one already existing file to another (`copymode()`), copying entire directories of files recursively (`copytree()`), and searching for files in a specified filepath (`which()`), as well as many other useful tools. These are generally called "high level" file operations, because they have less to do with specifically modifying small parts of individual files, and more to do with manupulation whole files or sets of files within storage. It can also be used for various archiving purposes (compressing and decompressing files for more efficient long term storage or transmission) including the `.zip` and `.tar` file formats.
