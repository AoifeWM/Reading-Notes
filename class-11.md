# Images and useful misc information

## Images

* can be easily formatted in CSS with height and width attributes
* You can asign a background image to almost any element in HTMl using css `background-image` attribute. works like `background-color`. If the image is too small, it tiles. Prevent tiling with `background-repeat: no repeat`, change size with `background-size`.
* `background-position` attribute can be used with `:hover` pseudoclass to create mouse-over effects with changing images
* gradient images (useful for backgrounds) can be generated with the `-webkit-gradient(...)` or `-o-linear-gradient(...)` value, among others, when assigned to a relevant attribute

## Useful information

* Search engine optimization can be achieved with accurate use of elements (for instance headings, image alt text, links, page name etc. are all on topic and contain relevent keywords.) A meta tag with page description can also help a lot.
* To publish a site a valid domain name must be purchased from a domain name registry service. 
* Google analyitics is a good tool to determine how many people visit your site and some more in depth information about them. It is a free service and is easy to set up, a specific link just has to be added to the site's `head` and it won't change the site's appearance at all.
