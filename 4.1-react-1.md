# React

React is a javascript library which has a lot of packaged features which make creating sites easier. Instead of using html, the webpage can be directly manipulated through javascript. This is becuase the html page is actually stored as an object in javascript; through something called *DOM manipulation* the object can be directly edited. This allows more control over the webpage than plain html because it allows things like conditional rendering, adding html elements modularly, etc. Html is not a programming language so it does not have these capabilities by default.

## JSX

JSX is a *syntax extension* of javascript. In plain terms, this is just a way that javascript can treat html elements as values to assign to variables, in the same way you might assign a string or an int. For example:

```js
username = "aoife1"
let title = <h1>Welcome to my webpage, {username}<h1>`
```

If `title` is appended to the DOM, it will show "Webcome to my webpage, aoife1" as an h1 tag.
