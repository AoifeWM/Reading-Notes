# Setting up a computer for coding 

A number of tools are important to set up on your computer to begin coding. These include:
* Text editor: Essential for writing and saving code. Many of these highlight and autocomplete various parts of code, and choosing one that works for your purposes is important. 
* Git: This tool allows the user to publish, modify, and download their code online. This is an especially important when working on code with multiple people, as it can organize changes from multiple users so that many people can work on a single project together.
* Homebrew: This tool makes downloading and installing various important applications much easier. 

## Which text editor is right for you?

Many different text editors are availiable for use. In the end, they all serve the same basic purpose, and their differences are mostly up to personal preference. While you *can* do everything with the most basic text editors like Notepad, some text editors come with extra features which are able to improve your efficiency, such as:
* Text completion: This feature suggests and automates changes which would otherwise take a lot of time, and keeps your code neat and clean, for instance, automatically indenting text when appropriate or automatically creating a closing tag when you type an opening tag. 
* Themes: This feature highlights different types of code (for instance, tags, variables, etc.) in different colors to make the code more readable. Some text editors let you customize these yourself. 
* Extensions: Extensions are plugins that come with extra features that make certain goals much easier. They vary depending on their intended use and tons of them are availiable, depending on your chosen text editor.

## The command line

The command line is a powerful tool which lets you interact with your computer much more directly than standard visual user interfaces. Understanding how to use your command line is an important first step in learning to code. Here are some important commands you may want to memorize:
* cd: this command changes the directory your command line is 'looking at', and can be used in reference to your current folder, or you can specify an entire path to any file on your system.
* ls: this command lists all the files in your current directory.
* mkdir \[name\]: this command creates a new folder with a set name.
* touch \[name.extension\]: this command creates a new file with a set name and extension, for instance document.text.
* rm \[name\]: this command removes a given file or folder. Watch out what you put after it!
* mv \[file to move\] \[location to move to\]: this command moves a file from one place to another.
* clear: this command simply clears all the text in the window.
* cp \[file\] \[location\]: this command makes a new copy of the selected file in the selected location.
