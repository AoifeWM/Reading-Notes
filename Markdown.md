# What is markdown?

Markdown is a language which is used to quickly format text for github, and various other places across the web. It has a number of features which allow you to *easily* **format** text with a few extra characters beside the plaintext. 

## Sample markdown formats
Headers can be created by starting a new line and adding a number of hashtags (#) up to 6 and then a space, and then adding the desired text. The more hashtags, the smaller the header is. 
Itallic and bold text can be created with one and two sets of asterix's surrounding the text, respectively. For instance, \*itallics\* will appear as *itallics* and \*\*bold\*\* as **bold**.

Lists can be made in two ways:
* Prefacing lines with an asterix and a space (unordered list)
2. Prefacing lines with a number and a period and then a space (1., 2., etc.) (ordered list)

Quotes can be made by putting a \> and a space before a line, for example
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Links can be added in this format: \[This is a link to google\]\(https://google.com) which will appear as [This is a link to google](https://google.com)

Other markdown forms exist and can be found on markdown reference pages, for instance [this one](https://quickref.me/markdown).
