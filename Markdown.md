# What is markdown?

Markdown is a language which is used to quickly format text for github, and various other places across the web. It has a number of features which allow you to *easily* **format** text with a few extra characters beside the plaintext. 

## Sample markdown formats
Headers can be created by starting a new line and adding a number of hashtags (#) up to 6 and then a space, and then adding the desired text. The more hashtags, the smaller the header is. 
Itallic and bold text can be created with one and two sets of asterix's surrounding the text, respectively. For instance, \*itallics\* will appear as *itallics* and \*\*bold\*\* as **bold**.
