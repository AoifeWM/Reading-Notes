# Teams and Teamwork

I read [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) and learned a lot from it. It's important to keep a friendly and casual demeanor between team members in order to make sure everyone feels comfortable and not stressed out by coming to the group. When the group feels competitive people are not in their comfort zones and their work suffers as a result. One of the most important factors for successful teams is that all the team members contribute about the same amount, and team members pay attention to others feelings. Even if all the group members are really smart, collective intelligence drops when a few people dominate the conversation and other people feel left out or discouraged from contributing. This means not embarassing or 'punishing' someone for speaking up even if you disagree with their ideas. You need to establish psychologically safe environments for groups to work at their peak efficiency.
