# CSS layout

Layout is an important principle in CSS and can be achieved in many ways. `<div>` elements are one of the most common ways, as they are a generic line-breaking container which can be easily tagged with a class or ID to target it with in CSS. By default, browsers display pages in *normal flow* which means each element appears sequentially one after the other, top to bottom, although this can be change in CSS. Relative positioning maintains normal flow but changes relative to its normal placement. Absolute positioning maintains placemenet relative to the browser window, and fixed positioning maintains placement relative to its parent element. Floating elements are taken out of normal flow and placed somewhere else (which necessitates a defined width) and other elements flow around them without overlapping (for instance, a picture embedded in the side of an article will probably be a floating element).
There are two basic styles for layouts: fixed width and stretchy. Fixed width layouts will usually rely on fixed measurements to space elements, such as pixels or rems, while stretchy layouts will rely on relative measurements (often in percents) to change the size of various elements depending on the size of the browser window.
The main content of most pages are kept in the range of 960-1000 pixels wide and information about the site on its landing page are usually kept to the top 600 pixels of the window, ensuring the user can see them without scrolling.
